# SpectralAI

Spectral AI is an innovative platform that dissects instrumental music into its fundamental frequency components and allows users to interact with and explore each individual frequency. By combining advanced digital signal processing techniques with generative AI, Spectral AI serves as both a creative tool for musicians and an educational resource for enthusiasts of audio signal processing.

## Features

- **Frequency Decomposition**
  - Converts audio files (e.g., `.wav`, `.mp3`) into their frequency-domain representations using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).
  - Isolates individual frequency components for detailed analysis and manipulation.

- **Generative Reconstruction**
  - Utilizes generative AI models (e.g., WaveNet, DiffWave) to reconstruct and enhance isolated frequency components.
  - Preserves the unique characteristics of the original sound while enabling creative modifications.

- **Interactive Playback and Visualization**
  - Offers a user-friendly interface for playing back and exploring each separated frequency.
  - Provides dynamic visualizations of spectral content to help users understand the structure of musical compositions.

- **Educational Insights**
  - Demonstrates key concepts in digital signal processing such as Fourier analysis, sampling, and filtering.
  - Acts as a hands-on learning platform for both audio engineering and AI-driven audio synthesis.
